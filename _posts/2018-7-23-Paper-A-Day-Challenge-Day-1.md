title: Meta-Learning Approach to One-Step Active Learning
---
### First Pass
*Questions*
  1. *What type of paper is this?* This paper presents a new hybrid method of meta training an active learning model. Instead of setting an initial heuristic which the model uses in order to consult some oracle, a learned model is used to consult an oracle.
  2. *What other research is this paper related to?* As the methods presented are a combination of emerging research topics in weak supervision, it would be useful to acknowledge **One Shot Learning**, **Meta Learning**, **Active Learning**, and **Monte Carlo Methods**. 
  3. *Do the assumptions seem to be valid?* As a novice, I will not make a claim about the validity of the claims made in the paper. I will, however, attest to the issue of gathering supervised data being a major concern in deep learning/machine learning.
  4. *What are the paper's main contributions?* Not sure.
  5. *Is this paper well written?* Again, as a novice it would be irresponsible to make some type of a claim. One major issue that troubles me, though, is that the introduction does not actually introduce the methods that they take to acheive the final result. Specifically, in the closing remarks, there is mention of employing a bi-LSTM, while it seems that the introduction seperates itself from that particular method.
